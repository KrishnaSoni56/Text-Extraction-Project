# Text-Extraction-Project
Hello Everyone ,

This is a another repository that i made on a Mini Project .

This repo includes a mini project about the vehicle number extraction using pytesseract , computer vision (cv2) and regular expression(re) libraries .

Also i have attached a test vechicle number image so that anyone can test it .

Note : The pattern in the code is written according to the image format , if any other other format doesn't match the pattern , then the code does not recognize your vechicle no .


Leave a star if you like my efforts  , 
Thanks!
